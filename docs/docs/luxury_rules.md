# Luxury Design Rules  
## BMW M4 Competition – Carbon Luxury

These rules define the visual identity of the project.
Breaking them will compromise the luxury intent.

---

## Core Principles
- Less information = more elegance
- Materials over graphics
- Motion must feel intentional, never decorative

---

## Color Rules
- Black and carbon are dominant
- White is used only for primary text
- M colors are accents, never focal points

Allowed opacity for accent colors: **max 40%**

---

## Typography
- Prefer BMW Type Next or Montserrat
- Avoid bold or condensed fonts
- Slight letter spacing is encouraged

---

## Layout Rules
- Centered composition
- Generous negative space
- No clutter near edges
- No borders thicker than 2px

---

## Data Display
- Only CPU temperature is allowed
- No percentages, RPM, or multiple sensors
- Numbers should feel calm, not aggressive

---

## Motion Rules
- No fast animations
- No flashing
- No hard cuts

If movement is noticeable at first glance, it is too much.

---

## Final Check
Ask yourself:
> Would this look at home in a BMW M cockpit?

If yes, the design is correct.
